## [Design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/144jtW66L-0ZZwGrfDMszdMhlkqkX44-Qd8UzTnvtcEg/edit?usp=sharing)
A design document for a project is an important document that outlines the key aspects of the project's design before its implementation. It is created to align all project stakeholders on its visual appearance, functionality, and other crucial aspects. This document encompasses a full description of the project, including its goals, tasks, and requirements relating to user interface, functionality, database structure if applicable, technical requirements, testing strategies, and implementation schedule.

## Graphic Editor
The program is a graphic editor created on the Windows platform. We used the Java programming language and the JSwing library to create a user-friendly and functional interface.

Our editor allows users to draw various geometric shapes such as points, lines, ellipses, rectangles, and cubes. Additionally, there is the ability to change the colors of shapes, delete unnecessary objects and save work in the file system. We also have a feature for loading work from a file, making it easy to integrate existing elements into new projects.

One of the key aspects of our editor is its ease of use. We aimed to create an intuitively understandable interface so that users can quickly master all the program's features and easily use them for their creative needs.
